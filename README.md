# 📊 Expectation Decider — Probability Analysis Project

🚀 A complete data analysis project that predicts whether a student will **pass or fail a competitive mathematics exam** using probability concepts, statistical reasoning, and Python.

This project demonstrates practical applications of:

✅ Probability Theory
✅ Conditional Probability
✅ Bayes’ Theorem
✅ Random Variables
✅ Contingency Tables
✅ Venn Diagrams
✅ Data Visualization

Perfect for **college submissions, data analytics portfolios, and beginner data science projects.**

# 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze student data and identify the key factors that affect the probability of passing an exam.

Using a generated dataset of **200 students**, we examine:

📚 Study hours
🎓 Attendance
👥 Group discussion participation
📝 Previous test scores
✅ Final exam result

The project applies mathematical formulas along with Python computations to derive meaningful insights.

# ⚙️ Dataset Overview

The dataset is **generated inside the notebook**, meaning no external files are required.

| Feature             | Description            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| study_hours         | Hours studied per week |
| attendance          | Lecture attendance (%) |
| group_discussion    | Participation (Yes/No) |
| previous_test_score | Marks out of 100       |
| final_exam_pass     | Pass / Fail            |

👉 Synthetic data is used to simulate real-world academic patterns.

# 📊 Major Analysis Performed

## ✅ Probability Calculations

* Probability of passing
* Probability of high attendance
* Conditional probabilities

## ✅ Random Variable

Defined the random variable:

> **X = Number of students passing out of 3 selected students**

Computed:

* Mean (Expected Value)
* Variance

---

## ✅ Contingency Table

Analyzed the relationship between:

👉 **Group Discussion vs Exam Result**

This helped determine whether the events are dependent or independent.

---

## ✅ Venn Diagram

Visualized overlap between:

📚 Students studying >10 hours
🎓 Students with attendance >80%

Provides intuitive understanding of joint probabilities.

---

## ✅ Bayes’ Theorem Application

Calculated:

> 🎯 **P(Pass | High Attendance)**

Result showed that students with high attendance have a **higher probability of passing**, proving attendance is a strong academic success factor.

---

# ⭐ Final Insights

### 🔥 Strongest Factors Influencing Success:

✅ High attendance
✅ Consistent study habits
✅ Strong previous scores
✅ Active participation

📈 Student performance improves significantly when these factors combine.
